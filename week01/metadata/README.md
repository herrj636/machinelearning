### motivations for taking this course

Envision ways to integrate ML into digital products

The learn more about the foundations of python and machine learning

To get my foot in the door of machine learning.

Learning python to create data loops. Learning how biases enter the algorithm development process. 

Learn something "hard-cored."

i am interested in artificial intelligence and want to know how it could inform my  design practice

wants to use machine learning in art and design

Learning about application of machine learning and some new models

I want to make cool things! I took Sven's ML course last semester and was introduced to a new world of AI and Machine Learning. Although the course was wonderful, I want to get more hands on experience with coding and ML. 

I would like to improve my coding skills and I am compelled by the challenge of applying programming to my other fields of study (environmental sciences, urban studies, mapping, data visualization) 

be able to quickly set a machine learning model used in my projects

Machine Learning definitely is a hot-button technology nowadays. I want to learn and know how to use it

I want to transition towards computational social science, and to further develop my skills in a more applied manner-- i.e. to help address real-world problems (be they business-related or social-related.)

To learn python, process large amounts of data, create algorithms, analyze data, and understand how machine learning is used in modern technology

Machine learning and Artificial intelligence systems are used everywhere nowadays and I want to catch up with these technical advancements since I am a tech enthusiast. 

there are a lot of conversations in DT about the implications of machine learning, yet I don't actually understand how it works technically. given that machine learning will inform the future of media/government/business/everything, i want to play a role in how the technology might be used as we go forward

I'm really interested in Machine Ethics, and if a machine should be held to certain moral standards.  In order to try to adding constrains and morality (if necessary ) to a machine's behavior, I feel the need to understand how we train machines and how they behave thoroughly to be able to see how morality comes into play in restraining machines' behavior and weather it's necessary  

I have a very hacky introduction to machine learning. I've used easy frameworks like ML5.js, Wekinator, RunwayML for previous projects. I'd love to get a better understanding with the fundamentals so that I can create my own algorithms with different data types (imagery, text, sound) for my projects. 

Learn new stuff.

I want to get a better understanding of machine learning. Thus far I've only worked with pre-trained models like yolo, and I would like to get a theoretical as well as technical understanding on how to train your own model.

I had some exposure to model building so I hope I can enhance my quantitative background through this course.

Machine Learning is changing the society and I want to be part of it

A developing interest in technology, and a desire to begin implementing models by the end of this course. 

I already took one of the courses before but i feel i did not get enough exposure to the terms and was not able to use that in my projects. Also, i am currently doing a program with Cornell Tech where I am required to know a bit about machine learning to be abe to catch up. I really would like to be more exposed to this field and be able to explore its potentials to understand the impact of AI on our lives to be a better "new generation" designer for our futures. 

I want to learn the principles of machine learning, understand how to use it for my own research projects in Data Visualization but also understand how it actually works to understand which process is adequate for a specific data set. 

Learning how to use machine learning as a solution for a problem and how to implement said solution in practice.

To gain technical skills that will let me make cool projects

Learn more about NLP for my thesis. And learn Python. 

I'm interested to build prediction based data visualizations and how to visualize data better with the help of artificial intelligence.

I have already taken ML elective in Fall 2018 and now I want to delve deeper into this field. Last semester I mainly used premed libraries, like ML5, posenet, imageclassification, etc, to do design. This semester I hope I can trained model and try to "build tools" myself rather than use tools made by others, which have a certain limitation in composition.

I come from Tongji University (located in Shanghai). In China, there is a huge E-commercial market and a huge demand for graphic design for their products. But those design work dose not have any creativity and they just repeat their past work. And I believe that should be replaced by machine. Moreover, there are already some intelligent system in China to solve this problem, like Luban. So I believe itÂ‰'s really important for me to learn about it!

Machine learning can be applied in many different fields--theoretically I understand how it is used in science, but am interested in seeing how it can be used for design and other fields. I've been surrounded by people who are experts in machine/deep learning but never got the chance to learn from the basics myself.

seeking a career as a fashion analyst

enhance creative practice

I'd love to work demystifying complex concepts often defined by complex data. I'm looking for new tools to achieve that goal.

I would like to use machine learning for projects that involve training algorithms for creative applications and more specifically data viz projects.
